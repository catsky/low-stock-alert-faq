## How does `instant` alert work?

In your alert, if `instant` schedule type is selected, then you will get instant alert once any of your selected product becomes low stocked according to your threshold. Alert email will be sent per inventory level of your product.

## Can I preview the alert email before it actually triggered?

Sure, you can. After you save the alert, then the button of `Send now` will be enabled in the preview section. You can immediately test and get an alert email. It won't change your next scheduled alert.
